Main root

<html>			The <html> HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, 
			so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants 
			of this element.


Document metadata


<base>			The <base> HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a 
			document. There can be only one <base> element in a document.

<head>			The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about 
			the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.

<link>			The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current document 
			and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS, but is 
			also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home 
			screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

<meta>			The <meta> HTML element represents Metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML 
			meta-related elements, like base, link, script, style or title.

<style>			The <style> HTML element contains style information for a document, or part of a 
			document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing 
			the <style> element.

<title>			The <title> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a Browser's 
			title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.



Sectioning root

<body>			The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only 
			one <body> element in a document.


Content sectioning

<address>		The <address> HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information 
			for a person or people, or for an organization.

<article>		The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, 
			application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable 
			(e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article,
			or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget,
			or any other independent item of content.

<aside>			The <aside> HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly 
			related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or 
			call-out boxes.

<footer>		The <footer> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or 
			sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the 
			section, copyright data or links to related documents.

<header>		The <header> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory 
			or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, 
			an author name, and other elements.

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, 	The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest 
<h4>, <h5>, <h6>	section level and <h6> is the lowest.

<main>			The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. 
			The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the 
			central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

<nav>			The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation 
			links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation 
			sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

<section>		The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't 
			have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, 
			with very few exceptions.


Text content

<blockquote>		The <blockquote> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. 
			Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for 
			the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation 
			of the source can be given using the cite element.

<dd>			The <dd> HTML element provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term 
			(dt) in a description list (dl).

<div>			The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the 
			content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, 
			or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

<dl>			The <dl> HTML element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of 
			terms (specified using the dt element) and descriptions (provided by dd elements). Common uses 
			for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

<dt>			The <dt> HTML element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such 
			must be used inside a dl element. It is usually followed by a dd element; however, multiple <dt> 
			elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next dd element.

<figcaption>		The <figcaption> HTML element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents 
			of its parent figure element.

<figure>		The <figure> HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, 
			which is specified using the figcaption element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are 
			referenced as a single unit.

<hr>			The <hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, 
			a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

<li>			The <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent 
			element: an ordered list (ol), an unordered list (ul), or a menu (menu). In menus and unordered 
			lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually 
			displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

<ol>			The <ol> HTML element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.

<p>			The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media 
			as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, 
			but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

<pre>			The <pre> HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in 
			the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or "monospaced, font. Whitespace 
			inside this element is displayed as written.

<ul>			The <ul> HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.


Inline text semantics

Element			Description	
<a>			The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink 
			to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a 
			URL can address.

<b>			The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, 
			which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the 
			Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, 
			you should not use <b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight 
			property to create boldface text, or the strong element to indicate that text is of 
			special importance.

<br>			The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful
			for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

<data>			The <data> HTML element links a given piece of content with a machine-readable 
			translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the time element must be used.	

<mark>			The <mark> HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation 
			purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or importance in the enclosing context.	

<s>			The <s> HTML element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the 
			<s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. 
			However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the 
			del and ins elements, as appropriate

<span>			The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which 
			does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling
			purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, 
			such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. 
			<span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas 
			a <span> is an inline element.

<strong>		The <strong> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, 
			seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

<sub>			The <sub> HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript 
			for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered 
			baseline using smaller text.

<sup>			The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript 
			for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised 
			baseline using smaller text.

<time>			The <time> HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may include the 
			datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for 
			better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

<u>			The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in 
			a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by 
			default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.

<var>			The <var> HTML element represents the name of a variable in a mathematical 
			expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized 
			version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.


Image and multimedia

<area>			The <area> HTML element defines an area inside an image map that has predefined 
			clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated 
			with Hyperlink.

<audio>			The <audio> HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may 
			contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the 
			source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the 
			destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.

<img>			The <img> HTML element embeds an image into the document.

<map>			The <map> HTML element is used with area elements to define an image map 
			(a clickable link area).

<track>			The <track> HTML element is used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. 
			It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to 
			automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)
			 — Web Video Text Tracks.

<video>			The <video> HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the 
			document. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the audio element may 
			provide a more appropriate user experience.
